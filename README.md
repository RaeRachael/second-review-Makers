## Second Review Done at Makers Academy
done on 04/08/2020  - 1 week after the course

### Verbal Feedback
* Take more time when naming functions, use it as a descripter for the action the function does. So for example 'apply_filter' as opposed to 'filter_pass'.
* Commits should Ideally start with a capital letter

### Post coding discussion
Included talking about the usefulness of extracting the edge case checks into a seperate function which could end up being useful is multiple kinds of filters would be needed.
